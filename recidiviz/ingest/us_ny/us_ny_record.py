class UsNyRecord(Record):
    """A subclass of Record that adds New York specific fields

    Datastore model for New York-specific fields in incarceration records. A
    single record describes one sentencing event. E.g., if a person were to
    commit armed robbery and larceny in one night, arrested, and given a
    sentence for N years for those crimes, this would be described in a single
    Record.

    UsNyRecord entities are stored as children of their respective inmate
    entities. There may be multiple records per inmate.

    See 'DOCCS Data Definitions' for full descriptions:
    http://www.doccs.ny.gov/univinq/fpmsdoc.htm

    Attributes:
        last_custody_date: (date) Most recent date inmate returned for this
            sentence (may not be the initial custody date - e.g., if parole
            was violated, may be readmitted for remainder of prison term)
        admission_type: (string) 'New commitment' is beginning to serve a term,
            other reasons are usually after term has started (e.g. parole issue)
        county_of_commit: (string) County the inmate was convicted/committed in
        custody_status: (string) Scraped string on custody status (more granular
            than just 'released' / 'not-released')
        earliest_release_date: (date) Earliest date to be released based on
            min_sentence. In certain circumstances, may be released before this.
        earliest_release_type: (string) The reason for the earliest possible
            release date.
        parole_hearing_date: (date) Date of next hearing before Parole Board
        parole_hearing_type: (string) Type of hearing for next PB appearance.
        parole_elig_date: (date) Date inmate will be eligible for parole
        cond_release_date: (date) Release date based on prison discretion for
            'good time off' based on behavior. Releases prisoner on parole, but
            bypasses PB review.
        max_expir_date: (date) Date of release if no PB or conditional release,
            maximum obligation to the state.
        max_expir_date_parole: (date) Last possible date of ongoing parole
            supervision. Doesn't apply to all inmates.
        max_expir_date_superv: (date) Last possible date of post-release
            supervision. Doesn't apply to all inmates.
        parole_discharge_date: (date) Final date of parole supervision, based on
            the parole board's decision to end supervision before max expiration.
        (see models.record for inherited attributes)

    (Note: for the three 'max_...'s, the latest date is considered controlling -
    that is, the inmate will not be released before that last date.)
